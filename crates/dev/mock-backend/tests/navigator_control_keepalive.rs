//! Regression: a navigator's reactive `nav_state` (`active_route` et al.)
//! must stay alive for the navigator's lifetime even when the SDK handler
//! doesn't retain the `NavigatorHost`.
//!
//! The bug (macOS drawer, "signal used after its scope was dropped"):
//! `active_route` lives in a scope owned by the navigator's `control`
//! (`retain_scope` → `control.owning_scope`). `NavigatorHandler::init`
//! takes the `host` (holding a `control` clone) BY VALUE, and handlers
//! don't store it — so once `init` returns, the only strong ref to
//! `control` can be a transient clone the handler captured. The macOS
//! drawer defers its sidebar build into a `schedule_microtask` whose
//! `control` clone is consumed when the builder closure returns, BEFORE
//! the walker builds the sidebar's reactive styles. A sidebar that reads
//! `active_route` reactively (a nav item's active-highlight) but doesn't
//! itself capture a `control`-bearing closure then dropped `control`'s
//! last ref mid-build, freeing `active_route` out from under the style
//! effect → SIGABRT.
//!
//! The fix anchors `control` in the framework's navigator keepalive
//! (`walker::navigator::build`), alongside the chrome/screen scopes, so
//! nav-state lifetime is deterministic regardless of what a handler keeps.
//!
//! This test reproduces the essential shape: a handler that captures the
//! reactive `active_route` and then drops the host (retaining no
//! `control`). After mount, `active_route` must still be readable. Before
//! the fix this panics ("signal used after its scope was dropped"); after
//! it, the read returns the initial route.
