# `storage`

Cross-platform **plaintext** key-value persistence for *non-secret* app
data — preferences, UI state, caches. One async `Storage` trait that maps to
each platform's native key-value store; `platform_storage(name)` hands you
the right backend for the current target as an `Arc<dyn Storage>`.

It's the `AsyncStorage` half of the storage split. Its sibling
[`credentials`](../credentials) is the `SecureStore` half — for secrets.

> **This is NOT secure storage.** Everything written here is in the clear
> and readable by anything with access to the device/browser profile (other
> code in the process, any script on the web origin, anyone with the device
> unlocked, a backup). There is deliberately no "secure" mode and no
> encryption — a store that *looked* secure but wasn't would be worse than
> an honestly-insecure one. **Never put tokens, keys, or any secret here**;
> use [`credentials`](../credentials).

```rust
use storage::platform_storage;

# async fn demo() -> Result<(), storage::StorageError> {
let store = platform_storage("my_app");      // Arc<dyn Storage>
store.set("theme", "dark").await?;
assert_eq!(store.get("theme").await?, Some("dark".to_string()));
store.remove("theme").await?;
# Ok(())
# }
```

## What you get

One async, object-safe `Storage` trait (held as `Arc<dyn Storage>`) with
string values — encode structured data (e.g. JSON) caller-side:

- `get(key) -> Option<String>` — value, or `None` if absent.
- `set(key, value)` — store, replacing any existing value.
- `remove(key)` — idempotent.
- `clear()` — remove every key owned by *this* store (its namespace only).
- `get_now(key)` / `set_now(key, value)` / `remove_now(key)` — the same
  operations answered **synchronously**, for the few values that must be
  known before the first frame (a saved theme read asynchronously boots
  light and flips to dark a tick later — a visible flash). Every store this
  crate ships is synchronous underneath, so these always answer for them;
  a custom `Storage` whose future would have to wait returns
  `StorageError::NotSupported` instead of blocking. Everything else should
  stay on the async calls or `persisted_signal`.

```rust
# fn boot() {
let store = storage::platform_storage("my_app");
// Before installing the theme — no flash of the default.
let dark = store.get_now("theme").ok().flatten().as_deref() == Some("dark");
# let _ = dark;
// In the toggle handler: persisted before anything reacting to it runs.
let _ = store.set_now("theme", "dark");
# }
```

Three ways to get a `Storage`:

- `platform_storage(name)` — the platform's native plaintext store,
  namespaced by `name`. **Infallible** to construct; backend errors surface
  per-operation as `StorageError`.
- `MemoryStorage::new()` — in-process, all targets. For tests and ephemeral
  state.
- `FileStorage::new(path)` — a JSON file on disk (native targets only); the
  whole map is rewritten on each mutation, suited to small key sets.

Every backend delivers the **same shape** — the platforms diverge in
mechanism, not in the trait you call.

## Per-platform mechanism

| Target | Backend (`platform_storage`) |
| --- | --- |
| web (wasm32) | `localStorage`, keys prefixed with `name` |
| iOS / macOS / tvOS | `NSUserDefaults`, keys prefixed with `name` (objc2) |
| Android | `SharedPreferences` file named `name` (JNI) |
| Windows / Linux / other native | a JSON `FileStorage` under the user's data dir (`%APPDATA%` / `$XDG_DATA_HOME` / `~/.local/share`) |

`clear()` removes only this store's own keys (the `name` namespace), not the
whole platform store.

Operations are `async` for a uniform surface across the genuinely-async web
backend and the synchronous native ones. On native the work runs
synchronously inside the returned future (fine for the small payloads this
is meant for; a high-throughput caller should batch).

## Permissions

None. Plaintext key-value storage needs no OS permission on any platform, so
this crate declares no capability and the CLI injects nothing.

## Scope

A flat string→string namespace per store — the unopinionated raw capability.
Typed values, reactive bindings, and migration helpers are deliberately left
to a higher-level SDK rather than baked in here.

## Testing checklist

Manual verification per backend — an unchecked **native** box means the code
compiles for that target but isn't confirmed on real hardware yet (see the
verification note above). Tick each item as you exercise it.

**Automated**
- [ ] `cargo test -p storage` — `MemoryStorage`/`FileStorage` round-trip, namespaced `clear`, idempotent `remove`
- [ ] `cargo build -p storage --target wasm32-unknown-unknown` — web (`localStorage`) target compiles
- [x] `cargo test -p storage` — `get_now`/`set_now`/`remove_now` share state with the async API (memory + file), and a store whose future would wait reports `NotSupported`
- [x] `cargo test -p storage --target wasm32-unknown-unknown` (headless Chrome through the workspace runner; `wasm-pack test` cannot load web-glue crates) — `tests/web_now.rs`: the `localStorage` store answers `*_now` under its `name:` prefix, round-trips non-ASCII, and `clear()` removes only its own namespace

**Behavior**

For each platform: a `set`/`get`/`remove`/`clear` round-trip survives an app
restart (data is genuinely persisted, not in-memory).

- [ ] **Web** — values persist via `localStorage` (keys prefixed with `name`) across a page reload
- [ ] **iOS** — values persist via `NSUserDefaults` across app relaunch
- [ ] **Android** — values persist via `SharedPreferences` (file named `name`) across app relaunch
- [ ] **macOS** — values persist via `NSUserDefaults` across app relaunch
- [ ] **Windows / Linux** — values persist via the JSON `FileStorage` under the user data dir (`%APPDATA%` / `$XDG_DATA_HOME` / `~/.local/share`) across relaunch
- [ ] `clear()` removes only this store's `name` namespace, not the whole platform store
