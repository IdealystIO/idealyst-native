//! Framework MCP — phase 1 prototype.
//!
//! Defines the [`ComponentEntry`] record and the [`inventory`]
//! distributed slice that `#[component]` populates when the
//! `runtime-macros/mcp` feature is on. Provides [`entries`] to walk
//! every registered entry and [`dump_catalog_json`] to emit the catalog
//! as JSON on stdout — the minimum surface for `cargo idealyst mcp
//! --json-catalog` to wire up.
//!
//! See `docs/mcp-catalog-spec.md` for the full plan. Phase 1 emits
//! the flat catalog with `composes` edges as bare idents. Phase 2
//! resolves those idents into fully-qualified [`EntryRef`]s via the
//! [`resolve`] module — same-module-first, then closest ancestor, then
//! workspace-wide (spec §6).
