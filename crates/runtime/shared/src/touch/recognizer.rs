//! The [`Recognizer`] finite-state-machine abstraction shared by every
//! stock recognizer (`tap`, `long_press`, `pan`, `pinch`) and by any
//! third-party recognizer.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! Each stock recognizer is a state machine over the raw [`TouchEvent`]
//! stream. Before this trait they were four independent closures with
//! private state enums — impossible to compose, prioritise, or coordinate.
//! `Recognizer` lifts the shared shape into one surface so the gesture
//! arbiter (see the `gesture` SDK) can drive N of them against a single
//! `on_touch` slot and resolve conflicts between them.
//!
//! The state vocabulary mirrors UIKit's `UIGestureRecognizerState`
//! deliberately, so the mental model transfers: `Possible → Began →
//! Changed* → Recognized | Failed | Cancelled`.
//!
//! ## Callbacks live inside the recognizer
//!
//! A recognizer owns its user callback (captured at construction, exactly
//! like the original `pan`/`pinch` factories). [`Recognizer::update`]
//! returns only the [`GestureState`] and the desired [`TouchResponse`];
//! the arbiter never sees the recognizer's typed output payload
//! (`PanEvent`, `PinchEvent`, …). This keeps the trait object-safe
//! (`Box<dyn Recognizer>`) with no associated type, and lets a recognizer
//! emit whatever shape it likes.
//!
//! ## Gating (require-to-fail)
//!
//! A recognizer must consult [`RecognizerCtx::may_recognize`] *before*
//! transitioning to [`GestureState::Began`] or [`GestureState::Recognized`]
//! (and before firing the corresponding callback). When it is `false` a
//! require-to-fail prerequisite has not yet failed, so the recognizer must
//! stay [`GestureState::Possible`] and re-evaluate on the next event. The
//! arbiter drives recognizers in dependency order within a single event, so
//! a prerequisite that fails on the same event (e.g. a pan that lifts
//! without crossing slop) has already reached [`GestureState::Failed`] by
//! the time its dependent (e.g. a tap) is driven — no event replay needed.
//!
//! Standalone use (the stock factory wrappers) passes
//! [`RecognizerCtx::UNGATED`], so `may_recognize` is always `true` and the
//! gate is a no-op — behaviour is identical to the pre-trait closures.
//!
//! ## Input gating: drivers call `drive`, implementors write `update`
//!
//! [`Recognizer::drive`] is the entry point every driver uses. It applies
//! the one input rule that holds for all recognizers — a `Began` from a
//! non-primary pointer button is ignored, never consumed — and then calls
//! [`Recognizer::update`]. Implementing a recognizer means writing
//! `update`; `drive` is provided and should not be overridden.
