//! TextInput primitive (controlled).
//!
//! Backed by `<input type="text">` on web, `UITextField` on iOS,
//! `EditText` on Android. The value is controlled — the parent owns
//! a `Signal<String>` that the framework subscribes to and writes to
//! the native widget; native input events fire `on_change` which the
//! parent uses to update the signal. Cyclic but stable: widgets
//! no-op when set to their current value.
//!
//! Why controlled by default? It matches the rest of the framework's
//! reactive shape — every input has a single source of truth (a
//! signal), and the parent decides how/whether to accept incoming
//! values (e.g. validation, transformation). Uncontrolled variants
//! can be added later if a real need arises.

/// Scope: this governs the "drop to no-focus" path only. Tapping ANOTHER input
/// always transfers focus (there is nowhere for focus to stay), so `Keep` means
/// "don't dismiss to nothing", not "trap focus forever".
///
/// Platform contract (CLAUDE.md §7 — same observable result, native mechanism):
/// - **iOS**: `UITextFieldDelegate.textFieldShouldEndEditing:` returns `NO` on
///   `Keep` — a native veto, so the outside-tap `endEditing:` respects it.
/// - **macOS**: the outside-click handler consults this before resigning.
/// - **web**: `blur` is not preventable by spec, so `Keep` re-`focus()`es the
///   input (one frame of flicker; focus is retained).
